# Song Popularity and Acoustic Features Visualisation  🎵 :notes: 

## Overview 🔧
This repository provides processes for visualising and analysing music popularity and their acoustic features using the MusicOset dataset. The analysis focuses on music in 2018. Visualisations include pie-donut charts, treemaps, coordinate parallel chart, scatter plots, and feature importance analysis using XGBoost. 

## Key Features 🔍
1. Data Preparation: Filtering, cleaning, and structuring song data.
2. Visualizations: Insights into song popularity and artist distribution using:
- Pie-donut charts 🎈
- Treemaps 🌲
- Scatter plots 🔸
- Coordinate parallel :abacus: 
3. Feature Importance: Using XGBoost for evaluating song attributes related to popularity.

## Installation 📝
1. Clone the repository:
> git clone https://github.com/your-repo/song-data-analysis.git
2. Install R packages:
> install.packages(c("webr", "ggplot2", "ggparcoord", "xgboost", "caret", "pROC", "Metrics", "viridis"))

## Results 🎉
Pie-donut chart: Shows popularity distribution.
Treemap: Highlights artist frequency.
Scatter plot: Reveals relationships between features like valence and energy.
Coordinate parallel: Displays acoustic features pattern across song popularity. 
Bar chart: Identifies key features impacting song popularity from XGBoost model.
